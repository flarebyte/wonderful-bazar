Some of the data available available in this repository come from third-party providers who hold their own license.
If you intend to use this data, ex Wikipedia, you should check their website where you could get the latest data but also the appropriate license.
Unfortunately, in some parts, code and data have been mixed together and it quite difficult to decouple the two after the facts.
Most of this code is meant as an experiment, and should be refactored in a more sensible way if meant to be used elsewhere.
