A collection of half finished products that could be revisited and implemented as libraries

A lot of these projects have been implemented as experiments for flarebyte.com Ltd, initially as close source.

Most of these projects have been discontinued.

Newer flarebyte.com projects tend to be open-source from the start, and there is a small chance to revisit some of this old code for future open-source libraries.

In the gap, feel free to borrow code for your open-source projects.
Just keep in mind that Data and Media (Images) are excluded from the MIT license.
