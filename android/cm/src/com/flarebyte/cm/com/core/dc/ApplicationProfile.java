/**
 * A Dublin Core Application Profile is a document, or set of documents, that
 * puts a Description Set Profile into a broader context of Functional
 * Requirements, Domain Models (such as Functional Requirements for
 * Bibliographic Records), guidelines on syntax and usage, and possibly data
 * formats. The metaphor of the Lego set has been used to describe this process:
 * an application designer should be able to "snap together" selected
 * "building blocks" drawn from the "kits" provided by different metadata
 * standards to build the construction that meets their requirements, even if
 * the kits that provide those blocks were created quite independently.
