== Decision process ==

=== Usual problems ===

 * Decisions are taken by managers who have a very high simplified view of the real problems, or are not aware of them.
 * People who understands clearly the problems or the solutions are very little involved in the decision process.
 * Each team or department are silos who communicate with each other through channels (managers). Departments tend not to rely on other departments. There is little synergy.

=== Proposed solution ===

 * Apply a bottom-up decision workflow. Everyone should be able to contribute and influence the decision process.
 * Introduce transparency to the decision-making to facilitate involvement. 
 * Final decisions will be taken by consensus.
 * Reduce the number of managers.
 * Introduce Process master roles who will watch that all the necessary steps and requirements of decision-making have been respected.
 * Implement tools to facilitate the participation to the decision making process.
 
== Communication ==

=== Usual problems ===

 * Email is the main communication channel. A great deal of knowledge is lost because not available to all.
 * Too many emails are useless to their recipients.
 * Reading emails is a disruptive task.
 * Priorities are badly implemented.


=== Proposed solution ===

 * Uses a custom communication tool for internal communications.
 * Encourage a forum/wiki approach.
 * Allows keyword tagging of subjects.
 * Allows keyword alerts.
 * Allows user to flag topic as "useful"/"useless" in order to promote useful topic to others. A simple "I like" button may be an option.
 * Non urgent emails should be read at specified time.

== Concepts ==

 * Study the possibility of representing a company as an insect society.
 * Study the possibility of rotating roles. Ex: scrum master.
